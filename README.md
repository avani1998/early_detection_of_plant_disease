# early_detection_of_plant_disease

This repository contains our code for the Deep Learning final project as part of the coursework of NYU. This project seeks to leverage deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to develop an efficient model for early detection of common plant diseases.

### Introduction:


In our exploration of different deep learning architectures for the early detection of plant diseases, we developed and trained three distinct models: GoogLeNet Inception V3, VGG, and ResNet. Upon evaluation, we found that the GoogLeNet Inception V3 model outperformed the other two in terms of accuracy. This finding aligns well with the results documented in the research paper "Using deep learning for image-based plant disease detection" by Mohanty, S. P., Hughes, D. P., & Salath√©, M. (2016), which also highlights the effectiveness of the GoogLeNet (V1) architecture in the field of plant disease detection. Our project, thus, not only reinforces the findings of this previous research but also provides a practical implementation of the same, demonstrating the efficacy of GoogLeNet Inception V3 for this specific application.


### Requirements
Tensor Flow (pip install tensorflow)
scikit-learn (pip install scikit-learn)

### Running
Run the ipynb files to regenerate the results, There is one code file for each of the model.
